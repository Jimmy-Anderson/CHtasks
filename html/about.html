					<h3>Objective</h3>
					<p>To encourage the school students to take up more algorithmic based programming challenges and excel in this Olympiads. If we can increase their problem solving skills as well as give them much needed motivation for taking up their interests to next level. We would train this talented batch of selected students for the ACM-ICPC as well as IOI. This would not only help them enhancing their skills but would also give them exposure to the real competitive world. We are working on several projects involving future technology
